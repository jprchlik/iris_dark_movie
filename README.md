A series of classes which create a movie from the IRIS dark.
The script dark_model_sub_script.py combines all the required
classes and produces a mission long movie of IRIS darks. 


The dark files with the model subtracted  are located in 
"../find_con_darks/calc_trend_darks/fits_files/". The 
Dark files are created if you run  sswidl -e "dark_trend,/simp"
in "../find_con_darks/calc_trend_darks/".
